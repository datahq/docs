https://docs.datapackaged.com

# Install

We use mkdocs http://www.mkdocs.org

1. You need to have python and pip installed
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (we differ from mkdocs instructions http://www.mkdocs.org/#installation because we have some extra dependencies)

# Building the site locally

```
mkdocs serve
```

# Deploy

Deploy is done automatically to the `gh-pages` branch by Travis. See Travis files for details.
