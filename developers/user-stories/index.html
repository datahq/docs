<p>DataHub is the place where <em>people</em> can <strong>store, share and publish</strong> their data, <strong>collect, inspect and process</strong> it with <strong>powerful tools</strong>, and <strong>discover and use</strong> data shared by others. [order matters]</p>
<p>People = data wranglers = those who use machines (e.g. code, command line tools) to work with their data rather than editing it by hand (as, for example, many analysts do in Excel). (Think people who use Python vs people who use Excel for data work)</p>
<ul>
<li>Data is not chaotic and is in some sense neat</li>
<li>Can present your data with various visualization tools (graphs, charts, tables etc.) </li>
<li>Easy to publish</li>
<li>Specific data (power) tools and integrations<ul>
<li>Can validate your data before publishing</li>
<li>Data API</li>
<li>Data Conversion / Bundling: zip the data, provide sqlite</li>
<li>Generate a node package of your data</li>
<li>(Versioning)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1-sign-in-sign-up-done">1. Sign in / Sign up [DONE]</h3>
<p>As a Geek Publisher I want to sign up for an account so that I can publish my data package to the registry and to have a publisher account to publish my data package under.</p>
<p><em>Generally want this to be as minimal, easy and quick as possible</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in with a Google account<ul>
<li>(?) what about up other social accounts?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Essential profile information (after sign in we prompt for this)<ul>
<li>email address</li>
<li>Name</li>
<li>(?) - future. Credit card details for payment - can we integrate with payment system (?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They need to choose a user name which is url friendly unique human readable name for our app. Can be used in sign in and in many other places.<ul>
<li>WHY? Where would we need this? For url on site &amp; for publisher</li>
<li>Same as publisher names (needed for URLs): [a-z-_.]</li>
<li>Explain: they cannot change this later e.g. "Choose wisely! Once you set this it cannot be changed later!"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Send the user an email confirming their account is set up and suggesting next steps</li>
</ul>
<p>Automatically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Auto-create a publisher for them<ul>
<li>Same name as their user name but a publisher</li>
<li>That way they can start publishing straight away …</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em><em>TODO: (??) should we do *all</em> of this via the command line client (a la npmjs) *</em></p>
<h3 id="sign-up-via-github-andor-google-done">Sign up via github (and/or google) [DONE]</h3>
<p>As a Visitor I want to sign up via github or google so that I don’t have to enter lots of information and remember my password for yet another website</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we deal with username conflicts? What about publisher name conflicts?<ul>
<li>This does not arise in simple username system because we have only pool of usernames</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-step-after-sign-up">Next Step after Sign Up</h3>
<p>As a Geek Publisher I want to know what do next after signing up so that I can get going quickly.</p>
<p>Things to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit your profile</li>
<li>Download a client / Configure your client (if you have one already)<ul>
<li>Instructions on getting relevant auth credentials</li>
<li>Note they will <em>need</em> to have set a username / password in their profile</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Join a Publisher (understand what a publisher is!)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="invite-user-to-join-platform">Invite User to Join Platform</h3>
<p>As an Admin (or existing Registered User?) I want to invite someone to join the platform so that they can start contributing or using data</p>
<ul>
<li>Get an invitation email with a sign up link</li>
<li><em>Some commonality with Publisher invite member below</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-publish-data-packages">2. Publish Data Packages</h2>
<h3 id="publish-with-a-client-done">Publish with a Client [DONE]</h3>
<p>As a Geek Publisher I want to import (publish) my data package into the registry so my data has a permanent online home so that I and others can have access</p>
<p>On command line looks like:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="linenums">$ cd my/data/package
$ data publish

&gt; … working …
&gt;
&gt; SUCCESS</code></pre>

<p>Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>Permissions: must be a member of the Publisher<ul>
<li>Internally: DataPackageCreate or DataPackageUpdate capability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Handle conflicts: if data package already exists, return 409. Client instructions should be already exists and use "--force" or similar to overwrite</li>
<li>API endpoint behind the scenes: POST {api}/package/</li>
<li>TODO: private data packages<ul>
<li>And payment!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="configure-client-done">Configure Client [DONE]</h4>
<p>As a Geek Publisher I want to configure my client so I can start publishing data packages.</p>
<p>Locally in $HOME store store something like:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="linenums">.dpm/credentials # stores your API key and user name

.dpm/config      # stores info like your default publisher</code></pre>

<h3 id="update-a-data-package-done">Update a Data Package [DONE]</h3>
<p>As a Geek Publisher I want to use a publish command to update a data package that is already in the registry so it appears there</p>
<ul>
<li>Old version will be lost (!)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="delete-a-data-package">Delete a Data Package</h3>
<p>As a Geek Publisher I want to unpublish (delete) a data package so it is no longer visible to anyone</p>
<h3 id="purge-a-data-package">Purge a Data Package</h3>
<p>As a Geek Publisher I want to permanently delete (purge) a data package so that it no longer takes up storage space</p>
<h3 id="validate-data-in-data-package">Validate Data in Data Package</h3>
<h4 id="validate-in-cli-done">Validate in CLI [DONE]</h4>
<p>As a Publisher [owner/member] I want to validate the data I am about to publish to the registry so that I publish “good” data and know that I am doing so and do not have to manually check that the published data looks ok (e.g. rendering charts properly) (and if wrong I have to re-upload)</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="linenums">data datavalidate [file-path]</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>[file-path] - run this against a given file. Look in the resources to see if this file is there and if so use the schema. Otherwise just do goodtables table …<ul>
<li>If no file provided run validate against each resource in turn in the datapackage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Output to stdout.<ul>
<li>Default: human-readable - nice version of output from goodtables.</li>
<li>Option for JSON e.g. --json to put machine readable output<ul>
<li>check goodtables command line tool and follow if possible. Can probably reuse code</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Auto-run this before publish unless explicit suppression (e.g. --skip-datavalidate)</li>
<li>Use goodtables (?)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="validate-on-server">Validate on Server</h4>
<p>As a Publisher [owner] i want my data to be validated when I publish it so that I know immediately if I have accidentally “broken” my data or have bugs and can take action to correct</p>
<p>As a Consumer I want to know that the data I am downloading is “good” and can be relied on so that I don’t have to check it myself or run into annoying bugs later on</p>
<ul>
<li>Implies showing something in the UI e.g. “Data Valid” (like build passing)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implementation notes to self</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Need a new table to store results of validation and a concept of a “run”<ul>
<li>Store details of the run [e.g. time to complete, ]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to automate doing validation (using goodtables we assume) - do we reuse a separate service (goodtables.io in some way) or run ourselves in a process like ECS ???</li>
<li>Display this in frontend</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cache-data-package-resource-data-on-the-server">Cache Data Package Resource data (on the server)</h3>
<p>As a Publisher I want to publish a data package where its resource data is stored on my servers but the registry caches a copy of that data so that if my data is lost or gets broken I still have a copy people can use</p>
<p>As a Consumer I want to be able to get the data for a data package even if the original data has been moved or removed so that I can still use is and my app or analysis keeps working</p>
<ul>
<li>TODO: what does this mean for the UI or command line tools. How does the CLI know about this, how does it use it?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="publish-with-web-interface">Publish with Web Interface</h3>
<p>As a Publisher I want to publish a data package in the UI so that it is available and published</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish =&gt; they already have datapackage.json and all the data. They just want to be able to upload and store this.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a Publisher I want to create a data package in the UI so that it is available and published</p>
<ul>
<li>Create =&gt; no datapackage.json - just data files. Need to add key descriptors information, upload data files and have schemas created etc etc.</li>

<li>Rufus: in my view generic search is actually <em>not</em> important to start with. People do not want to randomly search. More useful is to go via a publisher at the beginning.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Is it configurable for user that enable to push to npm or not?<ul>

<p>When we talk about versioning we can mean two things:</p>

<li>Explicit versioning: this is like the versioning Of releases “v1.0” etc. This is conscious and explicit. Main purpose:<ul>
<li>to support other systems depending on this one (they want the data at a known stable state)</li>
<li>easy access to major staging points in the evolution (e.g. i want to see how things were at v1)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implicit versioning or “revisioning”: this is like the commits in git or the autosave of a word or google doc. It happens frequently, either with minimum effort or even automatically. Main purpose:<ul>
<li>Undelete and recovery (you save a every point and can recover if you accidentally write or delete something)</li>
<li>Collaboration and merging of changes (in revision control)</li>

<h3 id="explicit-versioning-publisher">Explicit Versioning - Publisher</h3>

<ul>
<li>As a {Publisher} I want to version my Data Package and keep multiple versions around including older versions so that I do not break consumer systems when I change my Data Package (whether schema or data) [It is not just the publisher who wants this, it is a consumer - see below]</li>
<li>As a {Publisher} I want to be able to get access to a previous version I tagged so that I can return to it and review it (and use it)<ul>

<h3 id="explicit-versioning-consumer">Explicit Versioning - Consumer</h3>
<p>As a {Consumer} (of a Data Package) I want to know full details when and how the data package schema has changed and when so that I can adjust my scripts to handle it.</p>
<p>Important info to know for each schema change:</p>
<ul>
<li>time when published</li>
<li>for any <strong><em>changed</em></strong> field - name, what was changed (type, format, …?),
    &gt; +maybe everything else that was not changed (full field descriptor)</li>
<li>for any <strong><em>deleted</em></strong> field - name,
    &gt; +maybe everything else (full field descriptor)</li>
<li>for any <strong><em>added</em></strong> field - all data (full field descriptor)</li>
</ul>
<p>*A change in schema would correspond to a major version change in software (see <a href="http://semver.org/">http://semver.org/</a>)</p>
<p><em><strong>Concerns about explicit versioning</strong>: we all have experience with consuming data from e.g. government publishers where the publishers change the data schema breaking client code. I am constatnly looking for a policy/mechanism to guide publishers to develop stable schema versioning for the data they produce, and help consumers to get some stability guarantees.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Automated versioning / automated tracking</strong>: Explicit versioning relies on the publisher, and humans can forget or not care enough about others. So to help consumers my suggestion would be to always track schema changes of uploaded packages on the server, and allow users to review those changes on the website. (We might even want to implement auto-tagging or not allowing users to upload a package with the same version but a different schema without forcing)</em></p>
<p>As a {Consumer} I want to get a sense how outdated is the datapackage, that I have downloaded before, so that I can decide if I should update or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to preview a DataPackage changelog (list of all available versions/tags with brief info) online, sorted by creation time, so that I can get a sense how data or schema has changed since some time in the past. Important brief info:<ul>
<li>Time when published</li>
<li>How many rows added/deleted for each resource data</li>
<li>What fields(column names) changed, added or deleted for each resource.</li>

<h4 id="know-when-a-package-has-changed-re-caching">Know when a package has changed re caching</h4>
<p>Excerpted from: <a href="https://github.com/okfn/data.okfn.org-new/issues/7">https://github.com/okfn/data.okfn.org-new/issues/7</a></p>
<p><em>From @trickvi on June 20, 2013 12:37</em></p>
<p>I would like to be able to use data.okfn.org as an intermediary between my software and the data packages it uses and be able to quickly check whether there's a new version available of the data (e.g. if I've cached the package on a local machine).</p>
<p>There are ways to do it with the current setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the datapackage.json descriptor file, parse it and get the version there and check it against my local version. Problems:</li>
<li>This solution relies on humans and that they update their version but there might not be any consistency in it since the data package standard describes the version attribute as: <em>"a version string conforming to the Semantic Versioning requirement"</em></li>
<li>I have to fetch the whole datapackage.json (it's not big I know but why download all that extra data I might not even want)</li>
<li>Go around data.okfn.org and look directly at the github repository. Problems:</li>
<li>I have to find out where the repo is, use git and do a lot of extra stuff (I don't care how the data packages are stored, I just want a simple interface to fetch them)</li>
<li>What would be the point of data.okfn.org/data? In my mind it collects data packages and provides a consistent interface to get the data packages irrespective of how its stored.</li>
</ol>
<p>I propose data.okfn.org provides an internal system to allow users to quickly check whether a new version might be released. This does not have to be an API. We could leverage HTTP's caching mechanism using an ETag header that would contain some hash value. This hash value can e.g. be the the sha value of heads ref objects served via the Github API:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="linenums">https://api.github.com/repos/datasets/cpi/git/refs/heads/master</code></pre>

<p>Software that works with data packages could then implement a caching strategy and just send a request with an If-None-Match header along with a GET request for datapackage.json to either get a new version of the descriptor (and look at the version in that file) or just serve the data from its cache.</p>
